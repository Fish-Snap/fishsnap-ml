# (C241-PS013) Fish Snap - Machine Learning

<div align="justify">
  Indonesia is a maritime country and an archipelago, so it is very possible that Indonesia's livelihood is largely in the field of fisheries. There are many types of fish in Indonesia, especially marine fish.
  Because of the many types of fish, Indonesian people, especially teenagers, still do not know in depth about fisheries in Indonesia.
  To overcome this challenge and encourage interest, as well as educate the younger generation in the field of fisheries, we propose the creation of a mobile application in the field of fisheries.
  We propose to create an application that can classify fish, help the community in recommending the use of fish, and help generate income for fishermen or fish traders. Our focus is to educate the public and help fisheries practitioners.
  Our goal is to create an interactive program that can be easily accessed by everyone.
